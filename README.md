# CrossProductExampleUseCase

Research on the use of cross product.
It is used to find the vector perpendicular(Normals) to two different vector.
It is used in number of occassions including to calculate anglular momentum, magnetic field force.

Research findings.

Scene1

In this research it is used to compute the rotational axis and angle such that a cannon may face a target.
By the proof of rotational invariance of cross product,
cross producting 2 vectors will give the Normals of 2 vectors which will in turn be used with the dot product of vectors
to compute the required angle and rotational axis.


Scene2

This research research on its uses on computer graphics.
As computer graphics are made by polygons, by interpolating the normals of all the vertices on each polygon, 
it is possible to create a smoother representation of an object with relatively low geometric detail thus
reducing reducing the need to make a high res polygon of said object. 
It is also possible to use it to compute the how bright or shadowed a surface should look under a light source.
